# Orbio Guard

Local-first credit controls for Orbio-powered AI agents.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer.
- An Orbio account is required for authenticated MCP operations. Public OAuth discovery
  and configuration checks work without signing in.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run dev -- doctor
```

For machine-readable diagnostics:

```bash
npm run dev -- doctor --json
```

## Current status

- TypeScript/CLI scaffold.
- Validated runtime configuration.
- Live Orbio OAuth metadata discovery and unauthenticated MCP probe.
- Typed boundary for the current six-tool Orbio contract.
- Recursive credential redaction.
- Initial unit tests.

Authenticated OAuth, MCP tool execution, persistence, policies, proxying, and dashboard
work remain in later phases.
